        <h3>More CSS Practice</h3>

        <p>This was a project where I was given 5 screenshots of websites and I had
        to use CSS to re-create the layout. We were given screenshots so it would be
        more of a challenge so we couldn't inspect the page.</p>

        <h3>Project Structure Lab</h3>

        <p>In this project I did a combination of working with git and HTML.
        I first had to fork and clone the project from my instructor. Then I
        had to change the HTML file so that the links anchored in the file would
        work. After that I had to add the file, push it, and also commit it to
        submit it.</p>
